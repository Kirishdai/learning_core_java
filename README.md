# Core Java Practice ‚Äì learning_core_java

This repository contains my hands-on Java practice as part of my journey to become an enterprise-level Full-Stack Java Developer. Each folder is organized by concept and contains clean, runnable, and commented Java files.

## üìÅ Folder Overview

### `01_Basics`
- `TemperatureConverter.java`: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa using basic input and arithmetic.

### `02_ControlFlow`
- `NumberGuessingGame.java`: Demonstrates loops, conditionals, and the use of `Random` and `Scanner`.

### `03_Methods_Scope`
- `Calculator.java`: Uses methods and enhanced switch expressions to perform arithmetic operations with clean logic.

### `04_OOP`
- `InheritanceDemo.java`: Demonstrates class extension and method overriding.
- `PolymorphismDemo.java`: Shows runtime method dispatch using parent class references.
- `AbstractionDemo.java`: Uses abstract class and method to enforce base behavior.
- `InterfaceDemo.java`: Implements behavior via interfaces with multiple implementations.
- `GettersSettersDemo.java`: Encapsulates private fields with public getters and setters.

### `05_Collections`
- `ArrayDemo.java`: Basic array declaration, initialization, and loop traversal.
- `ArrayListDemo.java`: Demonstrates add/remove operations and iteration using ArrayList.
- `TwoDArraysDemo.java`: Traverses a 2D array using nested loops.

### `06_Exceptions_Files`
- `TryCatchDemo.java`: Demonstrates handling exceptions using try-catch-finally blocks.
- `CustomExceptionDemo.java`: Shows how to create and throw a custom exception class.
- `FileWriteReadDemo.java`: Writes to and reads from a file using `FileWriter` and `Scanner`.

### `07_AdvancedTopics`
- `AnonymousClassDemo.java`: Shows how to use anonymous inner classes for inline behavior.
- `GenericsDemo.java`: Demonstrates a generic class with multiple type parameters.
- `HashmapDemo.java`: Key-value operations including insertion, lookup, and iteration.
- `TimerTaskDemo.java`: Uses `Timer` and `TimerTask` to schedule a repeated task with a countdown.
- `ThreadingDemo.java` & `MyRunnable.java`: Demonstrates use of a daemon thread with a countdown timer that exits the program if input is not received in time.
- `EnumsDemo.java` & `Day.java`: Use enums with enhanced switch-case logic and associated values.
- `MultithreadingDemo.java` & `MyRunnable2.java`: Demonstrates concurrent thread execution using multiple threads and synchronization with `join()`.

##  Why This Repo Exists

I'm building this as part of a focused 4-month sprint to become internship-ready with senior-level Java development skills. Each file is intentional ‚Äî no filler, no fluff ‚Äî just fundamentals done right, with structure, readability, and purpose.
